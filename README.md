intro to Github, practice coding

Greetings

Name's Max...here I'm just playing with Github and honestly attempting to understand its setup.
My goals this summer are to learn more and more about coding every single day.
I'm determined to graduate, do work that matters and is important to me, tour my
comedy across the US someday and make a positive impact on Earth. That's what motivates me
every single day.
